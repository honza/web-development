Javascript
==========

Javascript is a programming language that has nothing to do with Java.  It's a
litle language that runs in the browser to provide client-side interactivity.
Javascript is a huge part of web development.

Javascript files are typically loaded along with the HTML document that makes
up the web application you are trying to access.  Javascript runs in the
browser uncompiled; the browser actually contains a Javascript interpreter that
parses your files on the fly.
