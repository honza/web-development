CSS
===

CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets and is a crucial part of web development.
In short, it's used to describe what a web page will look like visually.

CSS tells the browser how to display individual elements on the page.  It says
things like: make all headings blue; set the paragraph font to Helvetica; set
an image as the background of the page.

Typically, CSS rules are saved in a file and referenced as an external resource
from the HTML document that the file enhances.  CSS rules can be split over
multiple files to better organize related code.
