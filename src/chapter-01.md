Introduction
============

This book hopes to give you an idea of all the things that are involved in
making a moderd web application.  It won't teach you to program or even how to
make a basic website.  It will however describe the basic concepts of web
development and point you in the right direction as to where you should start
learning.  I will assume that you are a technical person, maybe a programmer.
There are no code samples in this book and I will try to make as
language-agnostic as possible.

I think the reason why I wanted to write a book like this is summarized in this
quote by Kaitlyn Trigger:

> Learning to program isn't the hard part.  The biggest challenge is figuring
> out how all the moving parts of a web application fit together.  There's no
> book for that.
