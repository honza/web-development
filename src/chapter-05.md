Website versus Web Application
==============================

So far, we have talked about websites.  A website is a general term for
something that is on the Internet.  However, some websites are actually what we
will refer to as *web applications*.  What's the difference?  A website will
usually present more or less static website and the primary reason for visiting
is to learn something by reading a page.  Good examples of websites are blogs,
restaurant websites, or even Wikipedia.  On the other hand, a web application
is characterized by an immersive, interactive user experience and allows you to
do something.  Good examples of web applications are Facebook or Google Maps.
