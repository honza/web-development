Executing commands on your server
=================================

In most cases, your server will be on the other side of the country or even
abroad.  You can't walk in to the datacenter and use your server like you would
a real computer.  So, you will need a way to remotely execute some commands on
the server from wherever you are.

The most common way of executing commands on a remote server is to log in to
your server via the SSH protocol.
