What's on the server?
=====================

As we said earlier, a server is just a big computer without a monitor that sits
somewhere in a datacenter.  What kind of computer is this?  What software is
installed on it?

The vast majority of the Internet is running on the Linux operating system.
There are many popular flavors of Linux such as Red Hat, Ubuntu or CentOS.  As
far as an introduction to web development goes, the choice makes little
difference.  If you are a Linux user, the server will have very similar
packages available as your standard desktop installation.

A server will have a few important applications installed and many optional
ones depending on your website's needs.  In almost every case, it will have a
webserver and a database.  Let's talk about those in turn.

A webserver is an application that is installed on the server machine and that
is responsible for answering requests from remote clients.  The two most
popular webservers are Apache and nginx (pronounced *engine-x*).  Webserver are
very complex applications that are usually written in a low-level language like
C and are optimized for stability, speed and low memory footprint.  A good
webserver will allow you to serve many requests simultaneously. 

A database is responsible for storing your website's data.  It can store
anything from the content of a blog post, to user login credentials or credit
card information.  Relational databases such as MySQL and PostgreSQL are very
popular.
