HTML
====

HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language and it's the founding block of any
web page.  HTML is a subset of XML.

An HTML document is the first thing that your browser will request when trying
to display a page.  An HTML document describes the structure of a page: it
tells the browser to display certain text as a heading and other text as a
paragraph; it tells the browser where to go look for images; it tells the
browser to download other resources such as CSS and Javascript.

Each HTML document should have a *head* and a *body*.  The head of an HTML
document will typically contain metadata about the current page and will often
link to external resources.  It contains the page's title, keywords and
character encoding.  The head isn't rendered in the browser.  The body of an
HTML document then contains the part of the page that will be rendered and
shown to the user.

The document can be saved on the server as a file which is served directly, or
it can be generated on the fly by a program on the server.
